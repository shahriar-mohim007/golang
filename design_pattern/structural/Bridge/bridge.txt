    Decouples an abstraction from its implementation, allowing both to vary independently. This pattern is useful when you have multiple dimensions of variation.
    Example: If you have different shapes (Circle, Square) and different colors (Red, Blue), you can separate the shape and color logic, 
    allowing any shape to be colored in any way.
