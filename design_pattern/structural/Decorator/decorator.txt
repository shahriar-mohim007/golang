Decorator Pattern

Purpose: Add responsibilities to objects dynamically.

Example: Add extra features to a basic Coffee object.

Adds behavior or responsibilities to individual objects dynamically, without affecting other objects of the same class.
This pattern is useful for extending object functionality without modifying the objectâ€™s class.
Example: Adding scrollbars to a window object without altering the window class itself.
