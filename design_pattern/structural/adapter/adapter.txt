Adapter Pattern:

    Converts the interface of a class into another interface that the client expects. This pattern allows incompatible interfaces to work together.
    Example: If you have a legacy system that outputs XML, but your application only works with JSON, you can create an adapter to convert XML to JSON.


Example: Suppose you have a LegacyPrinter that prints in a specific format, and you want to adapt it to work with a new Printer interface.
