The Memento Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that allows you to save and restore an object's state without exposing its internal details. It's useful when you need to implement undo/redo functionality.
Key Concepts:

    Memento: Holds the state of an object that can be restored later.
    Originator: The object whose state you want to save and restore.
    Caretaker: Manages the mementos but doesnâ€™t modify them. It saves and restores the originator's state using mementos.



Explanation:

    Memento: Stores the state of the TextEditor (the content).
    Originator (TextEditor): The object whose state we want to save and restore. It can create mementos and restore its state from a memento.
    Caretaker: Saves the history of states (mementos) and allows the originator to restore previous states.
