The Command Pattern is a behavioral design pattern where you encapsulate a request as an object, allowing you to parameterize other objects with operations, queue requests, and support undoable operations.
Key Concepts:

    Command Interface: Defines the method that encapsulates the action.
    Concrete Command: Implements the command by binding actions to specific receivers.
    Invoker: The object that triggers the command execution.
    Receiver: The object that knows how to perform the action.
