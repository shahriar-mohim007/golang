The Chain of Responsibility Pattern is a behavioral design pattern where a request is passed along a chain of handlers. Each handler can either process the request or pass it to the next handler in the chain.
Key Concepts:

    Handler: An interface that defines a method for processing requests.
    Concrete Handlers: Implement the handler interface and decide whether to process the request or forward it.
    Client: Initiates the request that moves through the chain.
